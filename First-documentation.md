# RESPONSIVE WEB DESIGN

### HISTORY OF RESPONSIVE WEB DESIGN:

Web design was formally built for large screens until the advent of the mobile screen, tablet screen, etc. There was a need to build applications that will fit into the new screen sizes and enhance its appearance.
Two approaches were used then to make an application responsive,
One was the **“liquid site”**, this would stretch to fill the browser window, this resulted in a squashed design on smaller screens. The other was the **“fixed width site”** which has a fixed size, in this approach the container wrapper is set not to move no matter the screen size. This approach does not support responsive design as it creates lots of white space on larger screens and risks a horizontal scrollbar on smaller screens.
